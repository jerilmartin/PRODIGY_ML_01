# House Price Prediction

## Quickstart
- **Dependencies**: Python, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn
- **Installation**: Run `pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn`
- **Usage**: Execute `python t1.py` to train and predict house prices.

## Overview
This project uses linear regression to predict house prices based on features like living area and number of bathrooms. The model is evaluated using RMSE and R-squared metrics.

## Data
- `train.csv`: Training data with features and target.
- `test.csv`: Test data for predictions.
- `t1.py`: Script for model training and evaluation.
- `t1submission.csv`: Predicted house prices.

## Results
- **Train RMSE**: 0.2596
- **Test RMSE**: 0.2685
- **Test R^2**: 0.6137
